                    The new superlight GT reimagines the breed. And the results are extraordinary. Strikingly beautiful. Engineered for continent-crossing capability. With an engaging yet comfortable ride. And generous luggage space…

                    In the new GT, these key ingredients are reinvented and applied in new, innovative ways. Then combined with power and performance that is undiluted McLaren. To create the lightest, quickest accelerating car in its class. A Grand Tourer has never been so thrilling. So refined. So engaging.

                    Suddenly, those Grand Tourer conventions look very old.

                <h2>Does it share components with the 720S?</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s more aligned with the Sports Series range, the 540s and 570s, than the Super Series. But elements are borrowed from the more expensive cars: the hydraulic dampers and suspension software are common for instance. The layout is common to all McLarens: central carbon tub with aluminium sub frames at either end, the engine in the middle and drive to the rear wheels alone. It’s longer overall and the tub also has a carbon upper section to support the tailgate – which can optionally open and close electrically.

                <h2>All the space for what you need and love</h2>
                <p>
                    The McLaren GTs sweeping, sculpted profile isnt simply our interpretation of what a Grand Tourer can be. But what it should be. Driven by our everything for a reason design philosophy. Fuelled by the spirit of innovation. It starts at the core, with a bespoke MonoCell II-T carbon fibre chassis for maximum strength but minimum weight  perfect for touring with power, speed and efficiency. Our iconic Dihedral doors are unique in the class, too. While the cars versatile, spacious and elegant form is a model of aerodynamic efficiency.

                <h2>THE SUPERCAR FOR EVERY DAY driver</h2>
                <p>
                    The GT is a joy to drive. Because it’s light, stiff and has a glorious mid-mounted engine for ideal weight distribution. And because McLaren DNA flows through every part. The advanced Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system, for example, keeps the car safe and stable in all kinds of conditions. As with every McLaren, there’s a brake steer system too. Always ready to subtly slow the inside rear wheel to sharpen turn-in and reduce understeer – giving you the confidence to apply the power earlier in challenging twists and turns.

               <h2>IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL</h2>
               <p>
                As a rule, Grand Tourers are comfortable. Insulating. Which often means theyre also heavy and unresponsive. Not to mention blunt when it comes to handling and driver engagement. The GT makes that rule obsolete. Blisteringly quick and responsive, it injects adrenalin and racing DNA into the class. And it does all of this while delivering a supremely refined ride.
                The innovative engineering makes the GT a true McLaren. Pioneering refinements like our Proactive Damping Control suspension. Just like you, this advanced system constantly analyses road conditions to adapt  predictively. And learns from every journey you make. The result? Ride comfort and handling precision thats perfectly optimized. Every moment. On every journey. You really can have it all. instant torque enables throttle response thats twice as fast as our pure petrol cars  seamlessly transitioning to the V6 engine to deliver a torrent of power from standstill. Infotainment and connectivity deepen your engagement too  including new HD touchscreens, Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ capability.

          <h2>NEXT GENERATION REFINEMENT</h2>
          <p>
            At McLaren, we don’t believe that luxury has to come with a walnut veneer.
                <br>
            Lots of weight. And wood. You’ll usually find both inside a conventional Grand Tourer. So in the GT, our design team have reimagined luxury. For a new era. Clutter and weight have been banished. Honed elegance is the design ethos. Light and space rules.
                <br>
            Everything you touch is beautifully made from ultimate quality, pioneering materials. There’s world-class softgrain leather. solid aluminium. And the option of soft, tactile Cashmere. Together, it creates a refined, welcoming environment – alive with technology, punctuated with light.
